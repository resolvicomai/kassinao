## Why Kassinão?

Bots like [Craig](https://craig.chat/) nail multi-track recording. AI note-takers like Otter or Fireflies nail summaries — but they **guess** who spoke (diarization), and that guessing breaks on crosstalk and non-English names.

Kassinão combines both **and sidesteps the hard part**: because every participant is captured on their **own audio track**, it already knows *exactly* who said what. The transcript and the AI minutes inherit that perfect attribution for free. It's open-source, self-hosted, and privacy-first.

## Features

- **🎚️ Multi-track** — one lossless FLAC track per speaker, all sample-aligned.
- **📝 AI transcription** with exact speaker names & timestamps. Engines: **AssemblyAI**, **Groq**, **OpenAI**, **Gemini**, or a **local** command (faster-whisper / whisper.cpp) for full privacy. Real **VAD**: only speech is sent to the API (no cost on silence, no silence hallucinations), with automatic retry/resume on provider rate limits.
- **📋 AI meeting minutes** — summary, decisions, action items (with owner/due), timestamped topics, and a **per-participant** breakdown.
- **🔊 Meeting page** — sticky audio player with **1×/1.5×/2× speed**, transcript grouped by speaker with **per-speaker colors**, in-page **search/filter**, karaoke-style follow-along, clickable timeline bar, one-click copy of action items, downloads in **MP3 / FLAC / single mix / Audacity project** — all behind **Discord login**.
- **🗂️ Web index with full-text search** — `/gravacoes` lists every recording you can access across servers, with channel filter and search inside transcripts, minutes and notes — results deep-link to the exact minute.
- **💬 `/ask` inside Discord** — ask your meetings a question right in Discord; the AI answers (ephemeral, only you see it) from the transcripts *you* can access, with `[hh:mm:ss]` citations linking to the exact moment. Optional `days:` window (default 30). Needs AI minutes enabled (OpenRouter or Groq key).
- **📤 Minutes posted to Discord** — when the minutes are ready, the bot posts a summary embed (summary + decisions + action items) to a channel admins pick via `/config minutes-channel` (defaults to the voice channel's chat); an optional `MINUTES_WEBHOOK_URL` fires a JSON webhook per meeting for self-hosted integrations (n8n → Notion/Jira…).
- **🔒 Real access control** — only people who were in the call (speaking **or muted**), people who can see the channel, the initiator, or admins can open a recording. A leaked link opens nothing.
- **🎛️ Live panel** in the voice channel with **Stop** / **Add note** / **📌 Mark moment** buttons (one click stamps the timestamp, no typing) and a `[RECORDING]` nickname indicator (visible consent).
- **🔌 MCP connector** *(optional)* — ask your meetings from **Claude Desktop / Cursor**: time-window queries, cross-meeting **action items with deadlines**, full-text search — each user scoped to exactly what they can already see. See [`mcp/`](mcp/).
- **🤖 Auto-record** — starts by itself when N people join a channel; stops when it empties.
- **⏳ Tiered retention** — `RETENTION_DAYS` expires only the **audio**; transcript, minutes and notes live `TEXT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 90), so search, `/ask` and the MCP connector keep working after the audio is gone.
- **❓ Built-in onboarding** — `/help` with interactive topic buttons; DM the bot and it replies with the guide too.
- **🌎 Bilingual** (pt-BR / English), **HTTPS via Cloudflare Tunnel** (no open ports), auto-stop, retention/expiry, crash recovery and graceful shutdown.

## Quick start

You need a machine with **Docker** and a **Discord application** ([1-minute setup](#1-create-the-discord-app)).

> **Do step 1 (create the Discord app) first** — the bot won't boot without `DISCORD_TOKEN`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/resolvicomai/kassinao.git && cd kassinao
cp .env.example .env      # fill DISCORD_TOKEN, APPLICATION_ID, DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET, BASE_URL
                          # tip: set GUILD_ID too, so slash commands show up instantly
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then **invite the bot** (step 1) and run **`/record`** in a Discord voice channel. That's it. Full walkthrough below.

> ☁️ **One-click deploy:** [![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/resolvicomai/kassinao) — blueprint in [`render.yaml`](render.yaml). Set `GROQ_API_KEY` + `TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER=groq` in the dashboard to turn on transcription & minutes.
> Avoid serverless (Vercel/Netlify) — the voice gateway needs an always-on WebSocket.

### 1. Create the Discord app
1. <https://discord.com/developers/applications> → **New Application**.
2. **General Information** → copy **Application ID** → `APPLICATION_ID`.
3. **Bot** → **Reset Token** → `DISCORD_TOKEN` (no privileged intents needed).
4. **OAuth2** → copy **Client Secret** → `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`; add `BASE_URL/auth/callback` under **Redirects**.
5. Invite it (replace `APP_ID`):
   `https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=APP_ID&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=68176896`

### 2. Make it reachable
- **Recommended — Cloudflare Tunnel** (HTTPS, no open ports): create a tunnel, then in `.env` set `TUNNEL_TOKEN` **and** `COMPOSE_PROFILES=tunnel`, point the public hostname to `kassinao:8080`, set `BASE_URL=https://your-subdomain.your-domain.com`, and re-run `docker compose up -d`. The bundled tunnel service only starts under the `tunnel` profile (so it never crash-loops when you're not using it).
- **Direct IP (dev/test only — no HTTPS)**: uncomment `ports: ['8080:8080']` in `docker-compose.yml` and set `BASE_URL=http://YOUR_IP:8080`. ⚠️ Discord OAuth only accepts `https` (or `localhost`) redirects, so the login/download page won't work over a plain IP — use the tunnel (or any HTTPS proxy) for real use.

### 3. (Optional) Turn on transcription + minutes
Best quality for the money (AssemblyAI for speech, any big-context model via OpenRouter for the minutes):
```env
TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER=assemblyai
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=...     # https://www.assemblyai.com — US$50 free credit
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...       # optional fallback engine (https://console.groq.com)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...  # https://openrouter.ai — minutes LLM (default: google/gemini-2.5-flash)
MINUTES_ENABLED=auto
```
OpenRouter is a paid LLM gateway (one key, many models, its own credits) — the minutes cost roughly a few cents per meeting.
Zero-cost path: `TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER=groq` with just a `GROQ_API_KEY` (free tier: 8 audio-hours/day; the minutes then run on Groq's free LLM in map-reduce for long calls).

## How it compares

| | **Kassinão** | Craig | Otter / Fireflies |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Multi-track (one file per speaker) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Perfect speaker attribution (no AI diarization) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (guessed) |
| AI minutes (summary, decisions, tasks) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Per-participant breakdown | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ |
| Self-hosted / your data | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Access gated by login (not "who has the link") | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Open-source (AGPL-3.0) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Price | Free | Freemium | Paid |

## Transcription backends

| Provider | Cost (per audio hour, **per track**) | pt-BR quality | Privacy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **AssemblyAI** (`universal`) | ~US$0.21 (**US$50 free credit**) | Top-3 on the Open ASR Leaderboard | Cloud | Default pick; auto-falls back to Groq if a `GROQ_API_KEY` is set |
| **Groq** (`whisper-large-v3`) | ~US$0.11 (free tier: 8 audio-h/day) | Excellent | Cloud (enable ZDR) | Best zero-cost option |
| **OpenAI** (`whisper-1`) | ~US$0.36 | Excellent | Cloud | Timestamped segments |
| **Gemini** (`gemini-2.0-flash`, default) | ~cents | Good | Cloud (paid tier only) | Free tier trains on your audio — avoid |
| **Local** (`faster-whisper`) | Free | Good (`small`+) | 🔒 Never leaves your server | Slower without a GPU; see [`scripts/transcribe-local.py`](scripts/transcribe-local.py) |

> 💡 Recording is **multi-track**, but only **speech** is sent (VAD trims the silence-padded tracks), so a 1-hour call costs ≈ the total spoken time — not hours × speakers. The AI minutes run once per meeting (OpenRouter or Groq), a few cents each at most.

## AI connector (MCP)

*Optional, off by default.* Plug your meetings into **Claude Desktop, Cursor** or any MCP client and ask them in natural language:

- *"What's pending this week, and who owns it?"* — aggregates action items with deadlines across meetings.
- *"List the calls in this channel between June 1 and 30."* — time-window queries (timezone-aware).
- *"When did Ana talk about the budget? Give me the link."* — search with deep links to the exact moment.

**Security by design:** the connector runs locally and only carries a **personal token**; the bot applies the *same* access check as the web page, meeting by meeting — each person sees only what they'd see on the site. Read-only, no audio, revocable. Meeting text is wrapped as untrusted data (prompt-injection defense).

Turn it on by setting `MCP_SECRET` (a strong secret, **≠** `COOKIE_SECRET`). Users self-serve at `/conectar-ia`. Client package & full docs: [`mcp/`](mcp/). For the basic "what did we decide?" case you don't even need MCP — the `/ask` command answers right inside Discord.

## Commands

| English | pt-BR | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `/record [channel]` | `/gravar [canal]` | Start recording (your voice channel, or the given one) |
| `/stop` | `/parar` | End it and generate the link with audio, transcript and minutes |
| `/note <text>` | `/nota <texto>` | Mark a note at the current time (or the 📝 panel button) |
| `/status` | `/status` | Current recording status |
| `/recordings` | `/gravacoes` | Your latest recordings, with links (filtered by access) — also links to the web index with full-text search |
| `/ask <question> [days]` | `/perguntar <pergunta> [dias]` | Ask your meetings — AI answers (only you see it) with timestamped citations, from transcripts you can access |
| `/config minutes-channel/view` | `/config ata-canal/ver` | Admin: pick the text channel where the minutes summary is posted (default: the voice channel's chat) |
| `/help` | `/ajuda` | Interactive guide (also replies in DMs) |
| `/autorecord on/off/view` | `/autorecord ligar/desligar/ver` | Automatic recording per channel (admin) |
| `/mcp new` | `/mcp novo` | Owner-only: generate an AI-connector code (members self-serve at `/conectar-ia` on the web) |

Anyone can record and stop. `/autorecord` and `/config` require **Manage Server**. Deleting a recording (from its page) is limited to the initiator or admins.

## Configuration

All options live in [`.env.example`](.env.example). Key ones:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` · `APPLICATION_ID` · `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` | — | Bot credentials (Developer Portal) |
| `BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Public URL for links & OAuth |
| `REPO_PUBLIC` | `false` | `true` shows the GitHub/source links and the "auditable" claim on the landing page |
| `TUNNEL_TOKEN` | — | Cloudflare Tunnel token (recommended HTTPS path; also set `COMPOSE_PROFILES=tunnel`) |
| `GUILD_ID` | — | Registers commands instantly in that server |
| `RETENTION_DAYS` · `MAX_RECORDING_HOURS` | `7` · `6` | Audio retention & max length |
| `TEXT_RETENTION_DAYS` | `90` | How long transcript/minutes/notes outlive the audio (never below `RETENTION_DAYS`) |
| `TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER` | `none` | `none` / `assemblyai` / `openai` / `groq` / `gemini` / `command` |
| `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` / `GROQ_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` | — | Key for the chosen provider (Groq key doubles as ASR fallback) |
| `MINUTES_ENABLED` | `auto` | AI minutes: `auto` (on when an OpenRouter or Groq key exists) / `true` / `false` |
| `MINUTES_PROVIDER` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `openrouter` when key set | Minutes LLM: `openrouter` (default `google/gemini-2.5-flash`) or `groq` |
| `MINUTES_WEBHOOK_URL` | — | POSTs a JSON (`minutes.ready`) per meeting to your integration; env-only by design (no SSRF via Discord) |
| `TZ` | `America/Sao_Paulo` | Timezone for dates (the web page uses the visitor's) |

## Security & privacy

Recording voice is processing **personal data**. Kassinão is built accordingly:

- Access is always validated by **Discord OAuth login** + participant/channel checks — never by "who has the link".
- The bot shows `[RECORDING]` in its nickname and posts a panel in the channel (visible consent).
- Run transcription **locally**, or enable **Zero Data Retention** on your cloud provider, so audio isn't retained by third parties.
- Secrets live only in `.env` (git-ignored) — **never** committed. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## How it works

Opus packets from each speaker are decoded to PCM and fed to **one ffmpeg per speaker** writing **continuous FLAC** (silence between speech compresses to almost nothing and keeps every track in sync). When the recording stops, the single **mix is pre-cooked** right away so the player starts instantly; the other downloads (MP3/FLAC/Audacity) are still cooked on demand and cached. Transcription and minutes run in a **serial queue** after the call: **VAD** (ffmpeg `silencedetect`) trims each track so **only speech segments** are sent to the ASR provider (**AssemblyAI** — with Groq fallback —, **Groq**, **OpenAI**, **Gemini**, or a **local** command), then the minutes LLM runs via **OpenRouter** or **Groq**; the web page refreshes itself until they're ready. The page authenticates with **Discord OAuth** (`identify`) and the backend re-checks with Discord who may open each recording.
